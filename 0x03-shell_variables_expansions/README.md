# 0x03-shell_variables_expansions

This directory contains scripts for the Shell, init files, variables, and expansions project. Each script is exactly two lines long and executable as required by the project specifications.
## Script Descriptions

- 0-alias: Creates an alias named `ls` with the value `rm *`.
- 1-hello_you: Prints `hello user`, where `user` is the current Linux user.
- 2-path: Adds `/action` to the end of the `PATH` environment variable.
- 3-paths: Counts the number of directories in the `PATH`.
- 4-global_variables: Lists environment variables.
- 5-local_variables: Lists all local variables, environment variables, and functions.
- 6-create_local_variable: Creates a new local variable `BEST` with the value `School`.
- 7-create_global_variable: Creates a new global variable `BEST` with the value `School`.
- 8-true_knowledge: Prints the result of 128 plus the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`.
- 9-divide_and_rule: Prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE` (both are environment variables).
- 10-love_exponent_breath: Displays the result of `BREATH` to the power `LOVE` (both are environment variables).
- 11-binary_to_decimal: Converts a number from base 2 (stored in `BINARY`) to base 10.
- 12-combinations: Prints all possible combinations of two lowercase letters, except `oo`.
- 13-print_float: Prints a number with two decimal places (number stored in `NUM`).

Each script starts with `#!/bin/bash` and ends with a newline.
